Created dashboard using HTML & CSS basis the data given in cities.cvs.Also, it includes individual pages for each plot. These pages contains the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. On a landing page, a page where one can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

The website must consist of 7 pages total, including:
-A landing page contains an explanation of the project & links to each visualizations page.
-Four visualization pages, each with a descriptive title and heading tag, plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison and a paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
-A "Comparisons" page that contains all of the visualizations on the same page so one can easily visually compare them. It uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations.(The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.)
-A "Data" page that displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
